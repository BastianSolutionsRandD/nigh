To run tests use:

    make

To run test using multiple concurrent processes, use:

    make -j8 test
    make -j1 ctest

The number after '-j' is the number of parallel processes to run.
This should be set to the number of hardware threads your CPU
supports.  Running tests is almost entirely CPU bound, so there is
little benefit in having the -j value exceed the CPU hardware thread
count.  (Unlike traditional builds in which CPU time is occasionally
idle while waiting for I/O.)

Optionally, you can specify the build type to be "release" (default),
"debug", or "valgrind":

    make -DBUILD_TYPE=debug -j8

All tests that start with "generated_..." are automatically generated
by "generate_tests.sh".  They should not be modified by hand.

The 'ctest' test suite is the suite of concurrent tests.  These test
internally start up and run multiple threads, and thus should not be
run concurrently with other tests.  They should be run one at a time.
Unfortunately gnumake does not provide a mechanism to have some
processes run concurrently and other to not.
